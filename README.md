# 1. Traditional Web Apps VS Single Page Apps

- There are two general approaches to building web applications today:
  - **Traditional web applications** that perform most of the application logic on the server (Server Side Rendering (SSR)).
  - **Single-page applications (SPAs)** that perform most of the user interface logic in a web browser, communicating with the web server primarily using web APIs.
- Use traditional web applications when:
  - Your application's client-side requirements are simple or even read-only.
  - Your application needs to function in browsers without JavaScript support.
- Use a SPA when:
  - Your application must expose a rich user interface with many features.
  - Your team is familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript, or Blazor WebAssembly development.
  - Your application must already expose an API for other (internal or public) clients.
    - This is can be controlled...
